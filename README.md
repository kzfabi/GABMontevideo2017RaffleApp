# Global Azure Bootcamp Montevideo 2017 Raffle App
App made for the raffle of Global Azure Bootcamp Montevideo 2017

At the end of the Global Azure Bootcamp Montevideo 2017 we had to raffle some prizes global sponsors of the event had for attendees. That's cool, problem was it was 4 PM and we didn't have a plan on how to raffle them, the raffle had to be at 4:30 PM. 

As we were on an Azure bootcamp, explaining why Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform is focused on developer productivity, fast and easy to be in the cloud quickly, I had the idea to create a fun and simple raffle app in just under 30 minutes, built using the ASP.NET Core Website Template and deployed to an Azure Web App Service.

The idea and implementation went well and attendees had fun with it and got the idea on how easy it is to code a simple app and get it running in the public cloud in a couple minutes, and even from the Visual Studio IDE, we didn't even have to use the Azure Portal to get it up and running. 

Here's the code for you to check, have fun!

Oh, and by the way, you can deploy it directly to your Azure cloud subscription by clicking the button below.
